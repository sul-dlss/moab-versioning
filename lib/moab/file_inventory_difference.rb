module Moab
  # Compares two {FileInventory} instances based primarily on file signatures and secondarily on file pathnames.
  # Although the usual use will be to compare the content of 2 different temporal versions of the same object,
  # it can also be used to verify an inventory document against an inventory harvested from a directory.
  # The report is subdivided into sections for each of the file groups that compose the inventories being compared.
  #
  # ====Data Model
  # * <b>{FileInventoryDifference} = compares two {FileInventory} instances based on file signatures and pathnames</b>
  #   * {FileGroupDifference} [1..*] = performs analysis and reports differences between two matching {FileGroup} objects
  #     * {FileGroupDifferenceSubset} [1..5] = collects a set of file-level differences of a give change type
  #       * {FileInstanceDifference} [1..*] = contains difference information at the file level
  #         * {FileSignature} [1..2] = contains the file signature(s) of two file instances being compared
