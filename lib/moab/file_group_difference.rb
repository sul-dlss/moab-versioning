module Moab
  # Performs analysis and reports the differences between two matching {FileGroup} objects.
  # The descending elements of the report hold a detailed breakdown of file-level differences, organized by change type.
  # This stanza is a child element of {FileInventoryDifference}, the documentation of which contains a full example.
  #
  # In order to determine the detailed nature of the differences that are present between the two manifests,
  # this algorithm first compares the sets of file signatures present in the groups being compared,
  # then uses the result of that operation for subsequent analysis of filename correspondences.
  #
  # For the first step, a Ruby Hash is extracted from each of the of the two groups, with an array of
  # {FileSignature} object used as hash keys, and the corresponding {FileInstance} arrays as the hash values.
  # The set of keys from the basis hash can be compared against the keys from the other hash using {Array} operators:
  # * <i>matching</i>  = basis_array & other_array
  # * <i>basis_only</i> = basis_array - other_array
  # * <i>other_only</i> = other_array - basis_array
  #
  # For the second step of the comparison, the matching and non-matching sets of hash entries
  # are further categorized as follows:
  # * <i>identical</i> = signature and file path is the same in both basis and other file group
  # * <i>renamed</i> = signature is unchanged, but the path has moved
  # * <i>copyadded</i> = duplicate copy of file was added
  # * <i>copydeleted</i> = duplicate copy of file was deleted
  # * <i>modified</i> = path is same in both groups, but the signature has changed
  # * <i>added</i> = signature and path are only in the other inventor
  # * <i>deleted</i> = signature and path are only in the basis inventory
  #
  # ====Data Model
  # * {FileInventoryDifference} = compares two {FileInventory} instances based on file signatures and pathnames
  #   * <b>{FileGroupDifference} [1..*] = performs analysis and reports differences between two matching {FileGroup} objects</b>
  #     * {FileGroupDifferenceSubset} [1..5] = collects a set of file-level differences of a give change type
  #       * {FileInstanceDifference} [1..*] = contains difference information at the file level
  #         * {FileSignature} [1..2] = contains the file signature(s) of two file instances being compared
