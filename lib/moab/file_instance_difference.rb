module Moab
  # A container for recording difference information at the file level
  # * If there was no change, the change type is set to <i>identical</i>
  # * If the signature is unchanged, but the path has moved, the change type is set to <i>renamed</i>
  # * If path is unchanged, but the signature has changed, the change type is set to <i>modified</i> and
  #  both signatures are reported
  # * If the signature and path are only in the basis inventory, the change type is set to <i>deleted</i>
  # * If the signature and path are only in the other inventory, the change type is set to <i>added</i>
  # This is a child element of {FileGroupDifferenceSubset}, which is in turn a descendent of {FileInventoryDifference},
  # the documentation of which contains a full example
  #
  # ====Data Model
  # * {FileInventoryDifference} = compares two {FileInventory} instances based on file signatures and pathnames
  #   * {FileGroupDifference} [1..*] = performs analysis and reports differences between two matching {FileGroup} objects
  #     * {FileGroupDifferenceSubset} [1..5] = collects a set of file-level differences of a give change type
  #       * <b>{FileInstanceDifference} [1..*] = contains difference information at the file level</b>
  #         * {FileSignature} [1..2] = contains the file signature(s) of two file instances being compared
